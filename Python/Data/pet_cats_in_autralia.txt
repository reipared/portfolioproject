algorithm marked outlier: Identifies events marked as outliers using a user-selected filter algorithm in Movebank. Outliers have the value TRUE. units: none
entity described: event

animal comments: Additional information about the animal that is not described by other reference data terms.
example: sibling of #1423
units: none
entity described: individual

animal ID: An individual identifier for the animal, provided by the data owner. If the data owner does not provide an Animal ID, an internal Movebank animal identifier is sometimes shown. 
example: 91876A, Gary
units: none
entity described: individual
same as: individual local identifier

animal life stage: The age class or life stage of the animal at the beginning of the deployment. Can be years or months of age or terms such as 'adult', 'subadult' and 'juvenile'. Best practice is to define units in the values if needed (e.g. '2 years').
example: juvenile, adult
units: not defined
entity described: deployment

animal reproductive condition: The reproductive condition of the animal at the beginning of the deployment.
example: lactating
units: none
entity described: deployment

animal sex: The sex of the animal. Allowed values are 
m = male
f = female

animal taxon: The scientific name of the species on which the tag was deployed, as defined by the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS, www.itis.gov). If the species name can not be provided, this should be the lowest level taxonomic rank that can be determined and that is used in the ITIS taxonomy. Additional information can be provided using the term 'taxon detail'. 
example: Buteo swainsoni
format: controlled list
entity described: individual
same as: individual taxon canonical name

attachment type: The way a tag is attached to an animal. Values are chosen from a controlled list: 
collar = The tag is attached by a collar around the animal's neck
glue = The tag is attached to the animal using glue
harness = The tag is attached to the animal using a harness
implant = The tag is placed under the skin of the animal
tape = The tag is attached to the animal using tape
other = user specified 
format: controlled list
entity described: deployment

comments: Additional information about events that is not described by other event data terms.

format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS 
units: UTC or GPS time
entity described: deployment
same as: deploy on date

deployment end type: A categorical classification of the tag deployment end, from a controlled list:
captured = The tag remained on the animal but the animal was captured or confined
dead = The deployment ended with the death of the animal that was carrying the tag
equipment failure = The tag stopped working
fall off = The attachment of the tag to the animal failed, and it fell of accidentally
other = other
released = The tag remained on the animal but the animal was released from captivity or confinement
removal = The tag was purposefully removed from the animal
unknown = The deployment ended by an unknown cause
format: controlled list
units: none
entity described: deployment

deployment ID: A unique identifier for the deployment of a tag on animal, provided by the data owner. If the data owner does not provide a Deployment ID, an internal Movebank deployment identifier may sometimes be shown. 
example: Jane-Tag42 
units: none 
entity described: deployment

duty cycle: Remarks associated with the duty cycle of a tag during the deployment, describing the times it is on/off and the frequency at which it transmits or records data. Units and time zones should be defined in the remarks.
example: 15-min fixes from 8:00-18:00 local time (0:00-10:00 UTC)
units: not defined
entity described: deployment

event ID: An identifier for the set of values associated with each event, i.e. sensor measurement. A unique event ID is assigned to every time-location or other time-measurement record in Movebank. If multiple measurements are included within a single row of a data file, they will share an event ID. If users import the same sensor measurement to Movebank multiple times, a separate event ID will be assigned to each. 
example: 6340565
units: none
entity described: event

location lat: The geographic longitude of the location as estimated by the sensor. Positive values are east of the Greenwich Meridian, negative values are west of it. example: -41.0982423 
units: decimal degrees, WGS84 reference system 
entity described: event

location long: The geographic longitude of the location as estimated by the sensor. Positive values are east of the Greenwich Meridian, negative values are west of it. 
example: -121.1761111 
units: decimal degrees, WGS84 reference system 
entity described: event

manipulation comments: Additional comments about the way in which the animal was manipulated during the deployment. Use 'manipulation type' to define the general type of manipulation.
example: Relocated from breeding colony on Smithers Island to release location at 70.02E, 21.21S
units: none
entity described: deployment

manipulation type: The way in which the animal was manipulated during the deployment. Values are chosen from a controlled list:

entity described: event

sensor type: The type of sensor with which data were collected. All sensors are associated with a tag id, and tags can contain multiple sensor types. Each event record in Movebank is assigned one sensor type. If values from multiple sensors are reported in a single event, the primary sensor is used. Values are chosen from a controlled list: 
acceleration = The sensor collects acceleration data
accessory measurements = The sensor collects accessory measurements, such as battery voltage
Argos Doppler shift = The sensor uses Argos Doppler shift to determine position
barometer = The sensor records air or water pressure
bird ring = The animal is identified by a band or ring that has a unique identifier
GPS = The sensor uses GPS to determine location
magnetometer = The sensor records the magnetic field
natural mark = The animal is identified by a unique natural marking
orientation = Quaternion components describing the orientation of the tag are derived from accelerometer and gyroscope measurements
radio transmitter = The sensor is a classical radio transmitter
solar geolocator = The sensor collects light levels, which are used to determine position (for processed locations)
solar geolocator raw = The sensor collects light levels, which are used to determine position (for raw light-level measurements)
solar geolocator twilight = The sensor collects light levels, which are used to determine position (for twilights calculated from light-level measurements).

example: T61 
units: none 
entity described: tag

tag readout method: The way the data are received from the tag. Values are chosen from a controlled list: 
satellite = Data are transferred via satellite 
phone network = Data are transferred via a phone network, such as GSM or AMPS
other wireless = Data are transferred via another form of wireless data transfer, such as a VHF transmitter/receiver
tag retrieval = The tag must be physically retrieved in order to obtain the data.

units: UTC or GPS time 
entity described: event

visible: Determines whether an event is visible on the Movebank map. Values are calculated automatically, with TRUE indicating the event has not been flagged as an outlier by 'algorithm marked outlier', 'import marked outlier' or 'manually marked outlier', or that the user has overridden the results of these outlier attributes using 'manually marked valid' = TRUE. Allowed values are TRUE or FALSE.
